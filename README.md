# Martron
Martron was designed for my cognitive systems course (Cogs300) in a team of 4. Most of the setup was provided in the course lab file which included the touranment arena and its setup. We were also provided with the CogsAgent and WorldConstant Scripts as well as most of the assets and prefabs. The bulk of our groups work can be found in the Martron.cs file where we eventually ended up using a hard coded version of Martron as it would always beat our trained
model during practice rounds. The hard coded version of Matron ended up defeating all the opponents and winning the tournamnet!
